The MATLAB file "algo1057.m" computes the coefficient matrix [A_{i,j}] that determines the system of inequalities given by (5) in [1].
The other MATLAB files "rempwr2.m" and "trc.m" are used by the main code "algo1057.m" to compute (2^s mod 1057), where s is a nonnegative number, and trace of a finite field element, respectively.
